â€˜() empty list

if a problem statement is about information of arbitrary size, you need a self-referential data definition to represent it

problems are collections of definitions: structure type definitions, data definitions, constant definitions, and function definitions.

design one function per task. formulate auxiliary function definitions for every dependency between quantities in the problem

design one template per data definition. formulate auxiliary function definitions when one data definition points to a second data definition.

wish list
-> maintain a list of function headers that must be designed to complete a program.
